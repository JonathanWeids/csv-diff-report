# CSV-Diff Report

CSV-Diff Report is a command-line tool for generating diff reports in Excel or
HTML format from CSV files.

Unlike a standard diff that compares line by line, and is sensitive to the
ordering of records, CSV-Diff identifies common lines by key field(s), and
then compares the contents of the fields in each line.

CSV-Diff is particularly well suited to data in parent-child format. Parent-
child data does not lend itself well to standard text diffs, as small changes
in the organisation of the tree at an upper level can lead to big movements
in the position of descendant records. By instead matching records by key,
CSV-Diff avoids this issue, while still being able to detect changes in
sibling order.


## Usage

CSV-Diff is supplied as a gem, and has dependencies on a few small libraries.
To install it, simply:
```
gem install csv-diff-report
```

To compare two CSV files where the field names are in the first row of the file,
and the first field contains the unique key for each record, simply use:
```
require 'csv-diff'

diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2)
```

## Unique Row Identifiers

CSVDiff is preferable over a standard line-by-line diff when row order is
significantly impacted by small changes. The classic example is a parent-child
file generated by a hierarchy traversal. A simple change in position of a parent
member near the root of the hierarchy will have a large impact on the positions
of all descendant rows. Consider the following example:
```
Root
  |- A
  |  |- A1
  |  |- A2
  |
  |- B
     |- B1
     |- B2
```

A hierarchy traversal of this tree into a parent-child format would generate a CSV
as follows:
```
Root,A
A,A1
A,A2
Root,B
B,B1
B,B2
```

If the positions of A and B were swapped, a hierarchy traversal would now produce a CSV
as follows:
```
Root,B
B,B1
B,B2
Root,A
A,A1
A,A2
```

A simple diff using a diff utility would highlight this as 3 additions and 3 deletions.
CSVDiff, however, would classify this as 2 moves (a change in sibling position for A and B).

In order to do this, CSVDiff needs to know what field(s) confer uniqueness on each row.
In this example, we could use the child field alone (since each member name only appears
once); however, this would imply a flat structure, where all rows are children of a single
parent. This in turn would cause CSVDiff to classify the above change as a Move (i.e. a
change in order) of all 6 rows.

The more correct specification of this file is that column 0 contains a unique parent
identifier, and column 1 contains a unique child identifier. CSVDiff can then correctly
deduce that there is in fact only two changes in order - the swap in positions of A and
B below Root.

Note: If you aren't interested in changes in the order of siblings, then you could use
CSVDiff with a :key_field option of column 1, and specify the :ignore_moves option.

## Warnings

When processing and diffing files, CSVDiff may encounter problems with the data or
the specifications it has been given. It will continue even in the face of problems,
but will log details of the problems in a #warnings Array. The number of warnings
will also be included in the Hash returned by the #summary method.

Warnings may be raised for any of the following:
* Missing fields: If the right/to file contains fields that are not present in the
  left/from file, a warning is raised and the field is ignored for diff purposes.
* Duplicate keys: If two rows are found that have the same values for the key field(s),
  a warning is raised, and the duplicate values are ignored.


## Examples

The simplest use case is as shown above, where the data to be diffed is in CSV files
with the column names as the first record, and where the unique key is the first
column in the data. In this case, a diff can be created simply via:
```ruby
diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2)
```

### Specifynig Unique Row Identifiers

Often however, rows are not uniquely identifiable via the first column in the file.
In a parent-child hierarchy, for example, combinations of parent and child may be
necessary to uniquely identify a row. In these cases, it is necessary to indicate
which fields are used to uniquely identify common rows across the two files. This
can be done in several different ways.

1. Using the :key_fields option with field numbers (these are 0-based):

    ```ruby
    diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2, key_fields: [0, 1])
    ```

2. Using the :key_fields options with column names:

    ```ruby
    diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2, key_fields: ['Parent', 'Child'])
    ```

3. Using the :parent_fields and :child_fields with field numbers:

    ```ruby
    diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2, parent_field: 1, child_fields: [2, 3])
    ```

4. Using the :parent_fields and :child_fields with column names:

    ```ruby
    diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2, parent_field: 'Date', child_fields: ['HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam'])
    ```

### Using Non-CSV File Sources

Data from non-CSV sources can be diffed, as long as it can be supplied as an Array
of Arrays:
```ruby
DATA1 = [
    ['Parent', 'Child', 'Description'],
    ['A', 'A1', 'Account 1'],
    ['A', 'A2', 'Account 2']
]

DATA2 = [
    ['Parent', 'Child', 'Description'],
    ['A', 'A1', 'Account1'],
    ['A', 'A2', 'Account2']
]

diff = CSVDiff.new(DATA1, DATA2, key_fields: [1, 0])
```

### Specifying Column Names

If your data file does not include column headers, you can specify the names of
each column when creating the diff. The names supplied are the keys used in the
diff results:

```ruby
DATA1 = [
    ['A', 'A1', 'Account 1'],
    ['A', 'A2', 'Account 2']
]

DATA2 = [
    ['A', 'A1', 'Account1'],
    ['A', 'A2', 'Account2']
]

diff = CSVDiff.new(DATA1, DATA2, key_fields: [1, 0], field_names: ['Parent', 'Child', 'Description'])
```

If your data file does contain a header row, but you wish to use your own column
names, you can specify the :field_names option and the :ignore_header option to
ignore the first row.


### Ignoring Fields

If your data contains fields that you aren't interested in, these can be excluded
from the diff process using the :ignore_fields option:
```ruby
diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2, parent_field: 'Date', child_fields: ['HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam'],
                   ignore_fields: ['CreatedAt', 'UpdatedAt'])
```

### Ignoring Certain Changes

CSVDiff identifies Adds, Updates, Moves and Deletes; any of these changes can be selectively
ignored, e.g. if you are not interested in Deletes, you can pass the :ignore_deletes option:
```ruby
diff = CSVDiff.new(file1, file2, parent_field: 'Date', child_fields: ['HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam'],
                   ignore_fields: ['CreatedAt', 'UpdatedAt'],
                   ignore_deletes: true, ignore_moves: true)
```
